You awake in a daze...
"Is this a prison cell?..."
The cold air renders you motionless...
There is a barred cell window...
You steadily walk towards the window to look outside...
You come to the conclusion that you are on the top floor of the compex...
As you pace back in forth in the cell...
You examine the cell door...
The lock is old and rusted...
You begin to violently thrash the door and the nuts break...
You are free...
Make haste to your escape...

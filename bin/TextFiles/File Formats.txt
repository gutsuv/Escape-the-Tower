Don't work with this file. It'll need to be changed later.
Your fault if code has to be redone. #NoComplaining

RoomsA
int roomId, String roomDescription, int exitRoomId, char direction, String description
Permanent room features. This file does not change
unless rooms start moving or some nonsense

RoomsB
int roomId, int puzzleId, int enemyId, int itemId
Rooms B is default thing that are initated on new game.
Load Game will use a different file formated the same way.
There is a good chance room ID will not be used in RoomsB
file but it is left there for clarity.
